### Hello World!! Welcome to my Profile 😁

My Name is Jamie Aquino. I am in my senior year of University at Edinburgh Napier studying Digital Media and Interaction Design. 👩🏻‍💻

I have a vast interest in all things Digital 😍, however, I am currently trying to learn Frontend Development and UX/UI. Frontend Masters Courses are my favourite resource at the moment! 🔥

I have a passion for Photography and Cinematography, and I try to create content when I have the time. 📸
I also love Fashion and Music and would love to work for companies like Spotify or COMPLEX. 🧥

Skills: 
Photography, Video Editing (Final Cut Pro X), Photoshop, Figma
